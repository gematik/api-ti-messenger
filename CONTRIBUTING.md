# Welcome to the gematik contributing guide <!-- omit in toc -->
 
Thank you for investing your time in contributing to our projects!
 
In this guide you will get an overview how you can contribute to our projects by opening an issue, creating, reviewing and merging a pull request.
  
## Reporting a security vulnerability
 
Please do not report vulnerabilities and security incidents as GitHub issues. Please report vulnerabilities according to [SECURITY Guideline](SECURITY.md).
 
## New contributor guide
 
To get an overview of the project, read the [README](README.adoc).
 
## Getting started
 
### Issues
 
#### Create a new issue
 
If you spot a problem with the docs, search if an issue already exists.
If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue.
 
#### Solve an issue
 
Scan through our existing issues to find one that interests you. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.
  
### Pull Request Process
 
- When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.
- Fill the [pull request template](Pull_request_template.md) so that we can review your PR. This template helps reviewers to understand your changes as well as the purpose of your pull request.
- Don't forget to [link the PR to the issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) if you are solving one.
- Increase the version numbers in any necessary files to the new version that this
  Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).
- Once you submit your PR, a project team member will review your proposal. We may ask questions or request additional information.
- We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using [suggested changes](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request)
  or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through the UI. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.
 
### Your PR is merged!
 
The gematik team thanks you.
 
Once your PR is merged, your contributions will be publicly visible on the [ti-messenger github page](https://github.com/gematik/api-ti-messenger).
