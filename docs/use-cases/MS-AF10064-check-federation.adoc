=== AF_10064 Check federation affiliation of a messenger service
This use case checks whether a messenger service is part of the TI-Messenger federation and applies to all use cases that have to check the Matrix domain of another messenger service. For checking the affiliation of the Matrix domain with the TI-Messenger federation, the messenger proxy uses a federation list that is provided by the registration service of its TI-Messenger specialist service. The storage time of the messenger proxy federation list is limited.
